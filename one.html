    	<b>AutoMobile</b>
    	</h3>
    	Providing people with incredible freedom of movement,<br> the automobile has made traveling great distances simple.<br>
    	 In addition, it has led to the creation of suburbs as people no longer 
    	 <br>need to live in the city center.

    	<b>Sanitation</b>
    	</h3>
    	You know what’s better than dying a horrible death<br> at the age of 36? Living longer… Sanitation designs across<br> the board have improved the standard of living<br> as well as more than doubled life expectancy.<br> Just think of all the extra years of work you can now enjoy!

    			<h3>
    	<b>Wheel & Axle</b>
    	</h3>
    	No list of top inventions can be complete without the wheel and axle.<br> Before the wheel showed up around 3500BC, we were <br>	very limited in how much and how far we could travel with products.<br> Adding a wheel to a cart allows for easily carrying large amounts,<br> opening the idea for trade centers, not to mention improving<br> the lives of any laborer. Add it onto a cart and you<br> now have transportation. Add it to the car<br> and you can travel almost anywhere.

    			<h3>
    	<b>Internal Combustion Engine</b>
    	</h3>
    	This was a tough one, as the steam engine is pretty great too.<br> We decided on the combustion engine primarily because<br> it’s small! Not to mention you don’t need <br>some guy shoveling coal into a furnace to make the magic happen.<br> Without this, we’re still stuck on the train to get everywhere,<br> the automobile doesn’t exist, and I’m still<br> cutting my grass with scissors.

    	<b>Written Language</b>
    	</h3>
    	Dating back to Sumerian in 3300BC, this was the key<br> step to disseminating knowledge from one generation to the next.<br> Just think where we would be if everything<br> we learned was passed down through stories from one person to the next.<br> I can’t even remember a phone number any longer,<br> so how could I be expected to how to understand<br> astrophysics without a book?!

    	<b>Compass</b>
    	</h3>
    	Navigating by star light is a pretty cool skill to have,<br> but it sure doesn’t work very well during the day <br>or on a cloudy night. The compass took care of that<br> problem, enabling mariners to travel far away from land,<br> opening up trade routes around the world, <br>and resulting in the discovery of unknown lands.<br> Wow, this is only number 4?!

    	We have a bit of a love / hate relationship with the light bulb.<br> Before it was around, productivity was limited to the<br> daylight hours, so when the sun went down everyone went<br> to bed, and then got up to start working when the sun <br>showed up again. The light bulb made it possible to work all day<br> and night, significantly increasing productivity.
